I am a MS in Computer Science student at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst. While doing my master's, I've had the opportunity to work in the <a href="http://www.iesl.cs.umass.edu/">Information Extraction and Synthesis Lab</a> headed by Prof.<a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/">Andrew McCallum</a>. I've also collaborated with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/taesung-lee/">Taesung Lee</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tuinhof/">Hessel Tuinhof</a> at IBM Research. I interned this summer at the <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/applied-ai-and-ml">Machine Learning Center of Excellence</a> headed by Dr Lidia Mangu.

My research interests are primarily linked to Natural Language Understanding. I am interested in what NLU sytems can tell us about human behavior and in what human cognition can teach us about building better NLU models. I am also interested in ethical, and explainable NLP and applying it towards social good.

Previously, I was a software engineer at Microsoft working on Azure and obtained my undergraduate degree in Computer Science from Manipal Institute of Technology, India.
